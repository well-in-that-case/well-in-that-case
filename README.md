I enjoy writing code when I get bored.

## Projects
- [ovtable](https://luarocks.org/modules/well-in-that-case/ovtable) for Lua. 
  - It's gained over 300,000 downloads on Luarocks and became marked as the most popular ordered field implementation for Lua.
- [LuaString](https://github.com/well-in-that-case/LuaString) for Lua.
  - A very simple module that provides implementations for common string operators. It has around 70,000 downloads.
- [Pluto](https://github.com/well-in-that-case/Pluto)
  - A highly-compatible superset implementation of Lua in C++ that turns the language into what I imagine an ideal Lua would be.
