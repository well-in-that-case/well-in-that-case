# Welcome to my profiler, stranger.
Here's some facts about me:
- I'm a self-taught hobbyist programmer. I'm quite good at Python & Lua, and I'm learning C.
- I enjoy making things that'll help other people make things, my recent project is [ovtable](https://luarocks.org/modules/well-in-that-case/ovtable) for Lua >= 5.2.
- I own an American bully named Rocco. Because of him, I have an absurdly soft sweet-spot for pitbulls. 
- I pride myself on having good code quality, please critique me if you spot anything! But, do spare preference.
